I want to build a knowledge graph. Please extract core entities from the given text following these guidelines:
- Select only 2-4 most essential, highest-frequency core entities
- Apply strict judgment: If identified entities don't reflect the overall theme of all reviews, or if comments are clearly meaningless duplicates, return an empty entities list
- Expand abbreviated entity names to full forms
- Entities must be closely related to the main topic/theme of the reviews. Extract concrete, meaningful entities - avoid vague concepts. Entities should be standalone noun forms

Output format:
```json
{
  "entities": ["Entity1", "Entity2"...]
}
```

Analyze the given text and output JSON directly without explanations.
