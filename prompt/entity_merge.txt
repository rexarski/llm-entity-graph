As a knowledge graph expert, please determine whether the following two entity names refer to the same thing and should be merged.

Entity 1: {entity1}
Entity 2: {entity2}

Please consider the following points:
1. Are they different language expressions for the same thing?
2. Is there a relationship between a formal name and an abbreviation/nickname?
3. Is there a relationship between an acronym and its full name?
4. Is there a clear semantic distinction?

Please respond directly with "yes" or "no":
- "yes" means these two names refer to the same entity and should be merged
- "no" means these two names refer to different entities and should not be merged.

Please answer only with "yes" or "no," without any explanation.
