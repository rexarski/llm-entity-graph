I want to build a knowledge graph. Please extract relationships between entities from the given entity list according to these guidelines:
- Only identify relationships where both source and target exist in the provided entity list
- Each relationship must reflect a review-based perspective with complete contextual/logical connections, avoid isolated or meaningless associations
- Focus on relationships that represent the most typical patterns across comments sharing similar themes
- Allow only one relationship per entity pair. Return empty relations list if no valid connections meet criteria

Output format:
```json
{
  "relations": [
    {
      "source": "Entity1",
      "target": "Entity2",
      "relation": "Contextual relationship description"
    }
  ]
}
```

Analyze the text and output JSON directly without explanations.
